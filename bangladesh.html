    <div class="mainfact">
      Bangladesh is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population
      exceeding 165 million people in an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi).Bangladesh is among the most
      densely populated countries in the world, and shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and
      Myanmar to the southeast; to the south it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated from
      Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim in the north. Dhaka, the
      capital and largest city, is the nation's political, financial and cultural center. Chittagong, the second-largest
      city, is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal. The official language is Bengali, one of the easternmost branches
      of the Indo-European language family.

          <h4 class="headlal">Lalbagh Fort</h4>
          <div class="lalbaghp">
            <p> Lalbagh Fort is a fort in the old city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Its name is derived from its neighborhood
              Lalbagh, which means Red Garden. The term Lalbagh refers to reddish and pinkish architecture from the Mughal
              period. The original fort was called Fort Aurangabad. Its construction was started by Prince Muhammad Azam
              Shah, who was the son of Emperor Aurangzeb and a future Mughal emperor himself. After the prince was recalled
              by his father, the fort's construction was overseen by Shaista Khan. The death of Shaista Khan's daughter Pari
          Bibi (Fairy Lady) resulted in a halt to the construction process, apparently due to Shaista Khan's
          superstition that the fort brought bad omen. Pari Bibi was buried inside the fort.
          
          Lalbagh Fort was built as the official residence of the governor of the Mughal province of Bengal, Bihar and
          Orissa. The complex includes the Mughal governor's house, the tomb of Pari Bibi and a mosque. It is covered by
          lawns, fountains and water channels. Its two south gates were previously grand arches. The original grand
          complex covered the governor's house and the two archways. The tomb of Pari Bibi was later added. Lalbagh Fort
          was modelled as a miniature version of great Mughal forts like the Red Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. During the
          reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, Mughal Bengal became the economic engine of the empire. Emperor Aurangzeb called
          Bengal the Paradise of Nations. Dhaka grew into an imperial city with one of the richest elites in the Mughal
          Empire, including members of the imperial family. Mughal artillery guarded the fort. Once located beside the
          Buriganga River, the river has retreated from the vicinity of the fort. The fort was depicted in European
          paintings during the 18th and 19th centuries.
          
          Today, Lalbagh Fort is one of the most visited sites in Dhaka. Several pieces of artillery are kept inside the
          fort. The Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation is funding a restoration project for parts of the fort.
          Lalbagh Fort is one of the most recognized symbols of Mughal rule in Bengal. <br>
        <h4 class="lalbaghph4">History</h4>
        <p>The Mughal prince Muhammad Azam Shah, third son of Aurangzeb started the work of the fort in 1678 during his
          vice-royalty in Bengal. He stayed in Bengal for 15 months. The fort remained incomplete when he was called
          away by his father Aurangzeb.

          Shaista Khan was the new subahdar of Dhaka in that time, and he did not complete the fort. In 1684, the
          daughter of Shaista Khan named Iran Dukht Pari Bibi died there. After her death, he started to think the fort
          as unlucky, and left the structure incomplete. Among the three major parts of Lalbagh Fort, one is the tomb of
          Bibi Pari.

          After Shaista Khan left Dhaka, it lost its popularity. The main cause was that the capital was moved from
          Dhaka to Murshidabad. After the end of the royal Mughal period, the fort became abandoned. In 1844, the area
          acquired its name as Lalbagh replacing Aurangabad, and the fort became Lalbagh Fort.
        <h4 class="lalbaghpstructure">Structure</h4>
        <p>For long the fort was considered to be a combination of three buildings (the mosque, the tomb of Bibi Pari and the Diwan-i-Aam), with two gateways and a portion of the partly damaged fortification wall. Recent excavations carried out by the Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh have revealed the existence of other structures.

          The southern fortification wall has a huge bastion in the southwestern corner. On the north of the south fortification wall were the utility buildings, stable, administration block, and its western part accommodated a beautiful roof-garden with arrangements for fountains and a water reservoir. The residential part was located on the east of the west fortification wall, mainly to the southwest of the mosque.
          
          The fortification wall on the south had five bastions at regular intervals two stories in height, and the western wall had two bastions; the biggest one is near the main southern gate. The bastions had a tunnel.
          
          The central area of the fort is occupied by three buildings-the Diwan-i-Aam and the hammam on its east, the Mosque on the west and the Tomb of Pari Bibi in between the two - in one line, but not at an equal distance. A water channel with fountains at regular intervals connects the three buildings from east to west and north to south. </p>

    <h4 class="ahsanhead">Ahsan Manzil</h4>
    <div class="ahsanp">
      <p>
        Ahsan Manzil is the erstwhile official residential palace and seat of the Nawab of Dhaka. The building is
        situated at Kumartoli along the banks of the Buriganga River in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Construction was started in
        1859 and was completed in 1872. It was constructed in the Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. It has been
        designated as a national museum.
        <h4 class="ahsanph4">History</h4>
        In Mughal era, there was a garden house of Sheikh Enayet Ullah, the landlord of Jamalpur Porgona (district), in
        this place. Sheikh Enayet Ullah was a very charming person, who acquired a very big area in Kumartoli
        (Kumartuli) and included it in his garden house. Here he built a beautiful palace and named it "Rongmohol"
        (Rangmahal). He used to enjoy here keeping beautiful girls collected from the country and abroad, dressing them
        with gorgeous dresses and expensive ornaments. There is a saying that, the founder of Dhaka (representative of
        mughal emperor) was attracted to one of the girls. He invited Sheikh Enayet Ullah to a party one night and
        killed him in a conspiracy when he was returning home. In anger and sorrow, the girl committed suicide. There
        was a grave of Sheikh Enayet Ullah in the north-east corner of the palace yard which was ruined in the beginning
        of the 20th century.

        Probably in the period of Nawab Alibardi Khan(Grandfather of Nawab Siraj-Ud-Daulah) around 1740 century, Sheikh
        Moti Ullah, the son of Sheikh Enayet Ullah, sold the property to the French traders. There was a French trading
        house beside this property. The trading house became wealthier after purchasing this property. In that time,
        French traders could do business here without paying any taxes by a decree from the emperor Aurangzeb. In that
        time, the French became very wealthy by doing business here in competition with the English and other European
        companies. They made a big palace and dug a pond for sweet water in the newly purchased property. The pond still
        exists in the compound of Ahsan Manzil which was called "Les Jalla" in that time. In the Seven Years' War, the
        French got defeated and all their properties were captured by the English. On 22 June 1757, the French left the
        trading house with a fleet of 35 boats from the river station of Buriganga in front of Kumartuli.

        In 1785, the French transferred the property to a French tradesman named Mr. Champigni, and retaken it at 1801.
        According to Paris agreement of 1814, the French claimed all their left properties at Dhaka, and in 1827 the
        property was again returned to the French. For the increasing power of the English, the French was forced to
        leave subcontinent. They decided to sell all their properties in Dhaka. So in 1830, the trading house of
        Kumartuli was purchased by the established landlord of Dhaka, Khwaja Alimullah.

        After some renovation work, the trading house became the residence of Khwaja Alimullah. In his time, a stable
        and a family mosque was added in the compound. After his death, his son Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Abdul Ghani
        made a great flourish to the property, and named it "Ahsan Manzil" after his son Khwaja Ahsanullah. In the east
        side of the old building, he made a new building with a different design, and also done great renovation work to
        the old building. Since then, the old building was called "Ondor Mohol" and the new building was called
        "Rangmahal".

        In the evening of 7 April 1888, a devastating tornado hit Dhaka city causing great damage. Ahsan Manzil was
        severely damaged and abandoned. An English engineer from Kolkata arrived here to examine the palace. He gave an
        opinion that except for the "Rangmahal", all the other parts of the palace would have to be reconstructed. So
        Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Abdul Ghani and his son Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah turned their full attention
        to rebuild the palace. Both of the buildings were reconstructed during that time with a new design and
        supervised by the local engineer Gobinda Chandra Roy.

        The old French building was reconstructed to a two storied building keeping similarity to the Rangmahal. A
        gangway was made with wood connecting the first floors of the two buildings. The most beautiful thing made in
        this time was the dome, which enhanced the beauty of the palace.

        After the death of Khwaja Ahsanullah in 1901, the glory of Ahsan Manzil was ended. His successors could not
        continue the glory because of the internal family quarrel. They rented different parts of the palace to tenants,
        who actually made it a slum. In 1952, government acquired the property and left in supervision of the Dhaka
        Nawab court. In 1985, Dhaka National Museum acquired the property and made it a museum following a massive
        restoration programme which utilised historic photographs of the property.
